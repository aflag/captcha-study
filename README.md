Breaking a captcha
===================

I have made a blog post about this project. It's the only documentation I have so far:

Update
======

The blog post is a bit outdated. Nowadays I'm not smoothing the image after
reducing the line sizes. Also, I'm scaling all digit images down to 16x16. I
have also increased the number of training captchas.

All that combined, now I have an accuracy of 90% (+/- 4%) according to my cross
validation test.
